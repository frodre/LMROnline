   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the LMR project documentation!
=========================================

The Last Millennium reanalysis code provides a framework for ensemble Kalman
filter paleoclimate reconstructions from [Hakim2016]_.

Contributing to docs
--------------------
The documentation needs more work!  If you'd like to contribute please
consider taking a bit of time to write on a topic.

A few examples off information still needed are:

* creating a proxy database
* pre-calibrating observation models,
* pre-calculating Ye values
* running verification scripts.

This list is by no means definitive.  If there's some usage of the LMR
framework that's not described, write about it! The documentation itself is
is written using reStructuredText format.
