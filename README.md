# LMR

Welcome to the Last Millennium Reanalysis Online (LMR Online) framework code base-- a toolset
for climate field reconstructions using ensemble data assimilation.  This is an offshoot of
the original LMR Framework (Hakim et al. 2016, [LMR](https://www.github.com/modons/LMR)).

This package is based off of the original [LMR framework](https://www.github.com/modons/LMR)
(Hakim et al. 2016) with enhancements to include climate forecasts via a linear inverse models,
([pyLIM](https://www.github.com/frodre/pyLIM) from Perkins & Hakim 
[2020](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019MS001778)).

For more information, please see the (in progress)
[LMR documentation page.](https://atmos.washington.edu/~wperkins/LMR/docs).
